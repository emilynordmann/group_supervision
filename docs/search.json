    "text": "1.1 Getting to know each other, topics, proposals\nIn the first session, the purpose is mainly to get to know each other - what topics are you interested in? We also have a look over what is required for the dissertation proposal and discuss what you can expect as part of supervision.\nEvery dissertation project is different, and the way I tend to supervise is to focus on us working together (both you and I, and also us as a group with your peers) to support you to develop a range of skills, culminating in your dissertation write up. I tend to be quite structured as a supervisor, and this is one reason I developed this document, as it will outline the process for you in advance, so you know what to expect. If there is something you would like added, let me know and I’ll see what I can do.",

    "text": "1.2 Expectations\nI have certain expectations in terms of how we will work together over the academic year. I have some below, but in our first group meeting, I will ask you to think about whether there are any you would like to add, or if there is anything you want to amend related to the points below.\n\n1.2.1 Communication\nI ask that all students working with me communicate with me, letting me know if they are unable to make a certain deadline or if something gets in the way of a task they had planned for a specific point in time. In return, I will communicate with you regularly, including when you can expect feedback, and will do my best to let you know if I have to delay something beyond what I had previously communicated.\n\n\n1.2.2 Attendance\nI ask that all students attend group sessions unless there is something urgent that has come up. Individual drop-ins are flexible and you don’t need to attend if you feel that you don’t need to meet in a particular week. Group sessions are held for 1.5h every fortnight, with individual drop-ins held in the weeks that we are not meeting as a group.\n\n\n1.2.3 Supportive space\nI want the dissertation group to be an encouraging, safe, space and the dissertation process to be an enjoyable (albeit challenging at points!) experience for everyone. This means that you should never hesitate to ask any questions (all questions are valid) and I’d like us all to work together to support each other. No one is perfect and we will all make mistakes during the process (including me). I’ve been supervising for quite a few years now and I haven’t yet managed to come across anything that we have been unable to sort after some discussion, so don’t worry about talking to me if something has gone wrong :).",

I will ask you to work with me to set these deadlines so that we agree them together.\n\nDifferences in timeline between primary and secondary data projects\nTypically, intros are sent in December/early Jan, methods in Jan/Feb and Results or Analysis in Feb.\nSections can be sent together or separately, although I would recommend separate.\nEveryone should choose deadlines for each section and it will be added to the deadline spreadsheet.\nI have a cut off for accepting drafts. This is usually two weeks before the deadline, so you should keep this in mind when setting deadlines (give yourself some wiggle room!).\nDeadline tracker- you will have to juggle the dissertation alongside other courses, so you need to work consistently on it but also take advantage of the quieter periods to work on it.\n\n\n1.4.1 Ethics\nFor those doing primary data collection. we will prioritise the ethics application from the very start - the reason for this is that you cannot recruit data unless you have your ethics approved, meaning that delayed applications can bring a project to a halt.\nFor secondary data projects, your priority is the research proposal and aligning a RQ with a data source.\n\n\n1.4.2 Dissertation\nDissertation section deadlines are not set in stone - I would much rather that you take an extra day or two if you need it rather than sending an unfinished draft (with the caveat that it will never be perfect). If this is the case, let me know and we can discuss options.\nAlthough it is unusual for this to be an issue, there will be a point where I am no longer able to look over drafts before the deadline. We will aim for dates before this, but my cut-off is that I don’t accept drafts once we reach 1st March. This is because it becomes very unlikely that I will be able to turn around feedback in time for you to be able to make meaningful changes by the submission .deadline in mid-March.",

There are certain times of the semester when my teaching load is heaviest when it might be two weeks but I will always be clear about this.\n\n\n1.6.2 What type of feedback you will receive\nI generally provide in-text comments, so that I can show you which part am I referring to in my feedback (where relevant). I will also give a global overview/summary. I will tend to focus on what can be improved, as this is the priority to help your writing develop. However, I will also let you know what you do well too.\n\n\n1.6.3 How you can ask for specific feedback\nIf you have specific parts you would like feedback on (e.g. if you are unsure about something), you can leave comments in your document (either at specific points or at the start) and I will respond to them when I am reading through. Try not to put the points you’d like feedback on in the message when you send the file to me, as I put the files elsewhere and don’t tend to refer back to messages. This makes it more likely that I’ll miss them if they aren’t contained in the document when I come to read it.\n\n\n1.6.4 What format should be sent for the drafts?\nAll documents (proposal, ethics, Intro, Methods, Results/Analysis) should be in Word. An exception to this is copies of standardised measures (this might be in pdf, which is fine).",

Do you have a fixed idea or are you still deciding? Do you know what approach you want to take, methodologically?

How might the data need cleaned?\nWhat would your RQ/hypotheses be?\nIf quant, what analysis would you do for each hypothesis?\nIf qual, how are you planning to analyse your data and why?\n\nRefer to the Example Research proposal and proforma on the Level 4 dissertation Moodle - it’s all in the section labelled “Project management and time saving tools”\n\n\n1.9.4 Other things to cover\n\nDissertation resources\nLevel 4 Moodle\nCollege vs. intranet for ethics\nSupervisor access to data\nUsing AI for your dissertation",

Remember that you can refer back to the paper if you need to\nSome papers will be more relevant (and therefore will have a longer summary) than others.\nIdentify what the key points/findings/arguments are\nEven when reading papers in preparation for the introduction, keep an eye out for anything that might be useful for your Discussion\n\nYou may like to keep a document specifically for the Discussion and take notes from your reading as you go. You don’t need to use all of these at the end, but it means you have some thoughts written down and don’t have a blank space (which can be a bit overwhelming).\n\nFurther details are linked in the document in Internal Resources\n\n\n\n3.1.3 General writing advice\n\nIt’s better to write something/anything than nothing.\n\n-   Be accountable to others\n\n-   Body doubling can be useful\n\n-   Block out time in your calendar\n\n-   Give yourself small goals - ten minutes of writing. It makes it easier to get started.\n\n-   Other people report that if you are really struggling, writing down what you are struggling with and just typign something is enough to get you into it, even if you spent the first five mins writing 'I don't have a clue what to write about'\n\nKnow thyself (do you write better in the morning or at night?)\nIt’s easy to get hung up on every single sentence. Split the process of generation and editing\n\nGeneration - just focus on getting words on a page. Don’t worry about spelling, looking papers up, grammar, punctuation, structure etc. It’s about getting the ideas down.\nEditing - later (give yourself some time between this stage and the generation stage), focus on getting the things you wrote into a coherent draft. Don’t focus on adding new information for now - think about how to structure it and editing it to make the most sense.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Bullet point introductions\nThings to think about:\n\nSet the scene for the reader\nDo the different paragraphs flow well?\nA good structure is to start off broad and end narrow (i.e. closer to your study)\nIt can be helpful to use sub-headings, especially if you are covering literature from quite different areas\nTry to synthesise literature (i.e. pull together literature from various sources, rather than concentrate on a study per paragraph)\nIs there a theoretical basis for your research?\nEnsure there is a clear justification for your study\nEnd your introduction by presenting your RQ (Qual) or your hypotheses (quant)\n\nFor the next group session, I would like you to write a bullet point introduction. I do not expect this to be perfect, and it can change down the line\n\nPost your introduction on the Teams channel before the next group meeting (in two weeks time).",

We have a UofG licence and there’s more information and the login via UofG IT.\n\nQualtrics is very powerful and doesn’t just do surveys, you can build experiments with randomised trials and between-subject conditions into it: Building a psychology experiment \n\nTest, test and test again\n\nIt’s important to make sure that scales are presented correctly. We’ve had one student have to start from scratch before because they put Strongly Agree - Disagree - neither agree nor disagree - Agree - Strongly Disagree and only noticed mid-way through data collection\nWe also had one project where the participants saw a picture and it wasn’t clear from the data which picture was presented (and it was the between subjects condition) and she had to start data collection again.\nDo not start data collection without extensive testing and I reiterate to let me know when it is ready for me to look over. Other supervisors may differ on this, but it’s caused issues in the past (see examples above).\nYou cansimulate responses in Qualtrics which can help you test that your planned analyses are possible. You can also write the code for the final analysis before you data is collected which means when the time comes, all you need to do is run the code!\n\nIf you want to recruit Level 1 student you will need to provide an extended debrief and use Sona- see my sway on how to do this)\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Data Collection (Qual projects)\n\nHow are you planning on collecting data?\n\nIf online, must use GDPR-approved system (e.g. Zoom or Teams)\nIf in person, will need a) appropriate recording equipment, b) a quiet space\n\nSome supervisors differ on their opinions on this, but I would encourage you to send out questions in advance for all participants, as it can be more accessible for certain people (e.g. those who are neurodivergent or who don’t speak English as a first language)\nThink about the process of collecting - it’s entirely normal to be a bit nervous\n\nPractise setting things up/recording etc.\nIt’s good to pilot things (e.g. with a friend). I’m also happy to help in office hours etc. and you can also practise with each other (i.e. others in the group) to help get comfortable\nCan be helpful to write a list of everything you need to cover at the start and end so that they don’t forget anything\n\n\n\n\n5.1.4 Data collection (secondary data)\nBy now you should have a concrete plan for your data collection / source.\n\nIf you’re collecting Reddit data, you should have piloted downloading / searching for relevant URLs.\nInclusion, exclusion, and data saturation criteria are also really important - regardless of the data source, you might not want to use all of it and you may need to set a rule for when to stop collecting data (e.g., if you’re using social media where there is essentially unlimited data). Make sure you have these criteria set in advance as much as possible.\nAt this point you also need to ensure that the data you have access to can actually be analysed in the way you’ve planned. With secondary data there’s sometimes unforeseen difficulties you’ll run into that you can’t plan for, but taking the time to think things through as much as possible will save you time in the long-run.\nIf things do go wrong or change from the intended plan, don’t worry - what’s important is transparency about when and why decisions were made, not that you got everything right in advance\n\n\n\n5.1.5 Evaluation in introductions\nIn RM2, Wil and Ashley have made some excerpts from intros and discussions for their labs. In today’s session, we will cover intros and do discussions in a later session.\nWe’ll review the poor and stronger versions and we then have a discussion about it (slides with notes). The three things we look at are: - Synthesising evidence - Focused criticism - Why is your study worth doing?",

    "text": "A.2 Secondary data\nIf you’re using secondary data for your dissertation, this means that you’re not going to create data yourself, instead, you’re going to use data that already exists. Secondary data can offer several advantages such as saving time, resources, and providing access to a wider scope of data than might be feasible for you to collect yourself. Secondary data can come in several different forms.\nAcademic Research Data: Many researchers collect more data than they use in their studies. This unused data can sometimes be accessed and reanalysed to answer a different research question than was originally proposed. This data is typically rigorously collected and validated, making it a reliable source. Reanalysing this data allows you to expand upon the original research, or approach it from a new perspective.\nPublic Databases: Numerous governmental, institutional, or organisation-run databases exist that provide a wealth of demographic, health, societal, and other types of data. Such databases can be national or international in scope, offering a vast amount of data for potential research questions.\nSocial Media and Online Data: Internet sources such as social media platforms, forums, and blogs generate a vast amount of data every day. These sources can provide rich qualitative and quantitative data for various research questions. For example, a thematic analysis of posts on a specific topic on Reddit can offer insights into people’s attitudes, experiences, or behaviors. However, it’s crucial to ensure that any use of this type of data is respectful of privacy considerations and adheres to ethical guidelines.\nIt’s important that your research question is aligned with the data that is available to you. Start by formulating a broad research question based on the literature as you would for primary research and then start looking for sources of data that might allow you to answer that question. You’ll find that you probably have to go back-and-forth between your RQ and looking for data until you find a good alignment. This means the set-up part of your dissertation will take longer than primary data collection, but, you don’t then have the time-consuming process of data collection so it all balances out.\nFinally, it’s essential to consider any ethical implications of your data sources and ensure you have the necessary permissions to access and use the data. Some secondary data sources may require you to obtain approval, provide acknowledgment, or adhere to specific usage policies. Always ensure to comply with these requirements and respect the rights of the original data collectors and participants.\n\nJournal of Open Psychology Data \n\n\n\nSecondary data sources - useful blog with a list of databases you can use to source secondary data \n\n\n\nBPS Ethics guidelines for internet-mediated research \n\n\n\nPreregistration of Secondary Data Analysis Template \n\n\n\nStudying Reddit: A Systematic Overview of Disciplines, Approaches, Methods, and Ethics \n\n\n\n‘Scraping’ Reddit posts for academic research?
